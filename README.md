# Windows Spotlight Scraper
I noticed that you can't find certain windows spotlight images online, so I made a program that copies, and renames spotlight wallpapers before they're gone.
This allows me to create custom background slideshows with the ones I like, or use them as inspiration in creative projects.


I use windows task scheduler to run the program on login.
I setup the action to run pythonw.exe with the script location as an argument.
