# Windows Spotlight Scraper
I noticed that you can't find certain windows spotlight images online, so I made a program that finds, copies, and renames spotlight wallpapers as they download, before they're gone.
This allows me to create custom slideshows with the ones I like, or use them as inspiration in my creative projects.


I used windows task scheduler to run the program on login.
I setup the action to run pythonw.exe with the script location as an argument.


Make sure to setup the folder locations correctly in the script.
